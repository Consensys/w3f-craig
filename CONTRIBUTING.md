Thanks for considering contributing!

A few rules of thumb:
- This repository uses Yarn.
- Code contributions should match the existing code style. 
    - `yarn lint` to check the formatting
    - `yarn lint:fix` to fix some of the issues
- Discuss additions/changes with us [on Discord](https://discord.gg/craig) before working on them.
- Make sure to run your own instance and ensure minor/major/dependency changes work correctly.
